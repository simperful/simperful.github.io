This Repo includes what I've written. In other words, this is my personal notebook.

I think git is a very suitable tool to take notes. The day I made the first note, github could not be linked in China. So I commit my notes in Gitee, a substitute of Github in China, for the convenience  in future. And I push the notes to a personal Repo.

That's all.
